## [Todolist](https://github.com/stelisevil/react-project/tree/master/src/projects/TodoList)
A simple Todo list application in React that focuses on my understanding of state, props, components and render, building on the fundamentals of Javascript and HTML/CSS. 
The Todo list is able to accept new tasks, delete and edit tasks, mark tasks as completed, assign categories to each task (i.e. Housework, Shopping etc.), create new categories and assign each a custom colour, remove categories and sort all tasks by category.
## [Twitter Dashboard](https://github.com/stelisevil/react-project/tree/master/src/projects/TwitterDashboard)
An application designed to show working with an API request to hydrate data into a dashboard that displays tweets based on a search. 
Each tweet response shows the tweet, a clickable username, the number of retweets and favourites and any hyperlinks within the tweet become clickable.
